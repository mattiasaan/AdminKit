# AdminKit

AdminKit is a lightweight, client-side web application that provides a collection of essential tools for system administrators, network engineers, and developers. All utilities are accessible from a single, clean interface and run entirely in your browser, ensuring your data remains private.

## Features

AdminKit is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it fast, portable, and easy to use. No installation is required.

The toolkit includes:

*   **IP Structure Breaker (IPv4)**: Analyzes an IPv4 address (with or without a CIDR prefix) to provide detailed information, including its class, subnet mask, network ID, broadcast address, and the available host range.
*   **Subnetting Calculator**: Calculates IPv4 subnets from a base network address. You can specify either the desired number of subnets or the required number of hosts per subnet, and the tool generates a list of resulting subnets with their network details.
*   **Encoder & Decoder**: Quickly encodes and decodes text strings. Supports three common formats: Base64, Hexadecimal, and URL.
*   **Timestamp Converter**: Converts between Unix timestamps (in both seconds and milliseconds) and human-readable date/time strings (local and UTC).
*   **UUID Generator**: Generates multiple version 4 (random) Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) with a single click.
